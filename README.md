## 2 area or perimeter
Description:

You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square. 
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
area_or_perimeter(4, 4) --> 16
Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

## 4 difference of volumes of a cuboid


In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

## 5 all star code challenge

Description:

This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

All Star Code Challenge #18

Create a function that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

strCount('Hello', 'o') // => 1
strCount('Hello', 'l') // => 2
strCount('', 'z')      // => 0
Notes:

The first argument can be an empty string

## 6 filter out the geese

Write a function, gooseFilter / goose-filter / goose_filter / GooseFilter, that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a filtered array containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]
For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]
Your function would return the following array:

["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]
The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as in the initial array passed to your function, albeit with the 'geese' removed. Note that all of the strings will be in the same case as those provided, and some elements may be repeated.
